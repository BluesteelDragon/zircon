## Setup
To begin, it is recommended to do
```
npm i @rbxts/zircon @rbxts/log
```

This will install both Zircon, as well as the logging support. It is recommended to use the logging as it can be filtered easily through the Zircon console.

## Features
- ### Zirconium Language Scripting
    Zircon comes inbuilt with a runtime scripting language called [Zirconium](https://github.com/roblox-aurora/zirconium). This allows you to run scripts against your game during runtime.

    More information on how to set this up, will come when Zircon is closer to being production-ready.

    Supports:

    - Functions
        
        Using `ZirconServer.Registry.RegisterFunction` +  `ZirconFunctionBuilder`
    - Namespaces
        
        Using `ZirconServer.Registry.RegisterNamespace` + `ZirconNamespaceBuilder`
    - Enums
        
        Using `ZirconServer.Registry.RegisterEnum` + `ZirconEnumBuilder`
- ### Structured Logging
    If you want logging for Zircon, you will need to install [@rbxts/log](https://github.com/roblox-aurora/rbx-log).

    Then to use Zircon with Log, you simply do 
    ```ts
    import Log from "@rbxts/log";
    import Log, { Logger } from "@rbxts/log";
    import Zircon from "@rbxts/zircon";

    Log.SetLogger(
        Logger.configure()
            // ... Any other configurations/enrichers go here.
            .WriteTo(Zircon.Log.Console()) // This will emit any `Log` messages to the Zircon console
            .Create() // Creates the logger from the configuration
    );
    ```

    This will need to be done on both the _client_ and _server_ to achieve full logging.

    All logging done through this can be filtered through the console itself. That's the power of structured logging! ;-)

## Registering and using Zircon Commands
Below is an example of how to register a command in Zircon:

```ts
import { 
    ZirconServer,
    ZirconFunctionBuilder,
    ZirconDefaultGroup,
    ZirconConfigurationBuilder
} from "@rbxts/zircon";
import Log from "@rbxts/log";

const PrintMessage = new ZirconFunctionBuilder("print_message")
    .AddArguments("string")
    .Bind((context, message) => Log.Info(
            "Zircon says {Message} from {Player}", 
            message,
            context.GetExecutor()
    ));

const CreatorCommand = new ZirconFunctionBuilder("kill")
    .AddArguments("player")
    .Bind((context, player) => {
        const character = player.Character;
        if (character) {
            character.BreakJoints()
        }
    });

ZirconServer.Registry.Init(
    new ZirconConfigurationBuilder()
        // Creates a 'creator' group
        .CreateDefaultCreatorGroup()
        // Creates a 'user' group
        .CreateDefaultUserGroup()
        // Adds an executable function called 'print_message', allowed to be executed by `User` (everyone)
        .AddFunction(PrintMessage, [ZirconDefaultGroup.User])
        // Adds an executable function called 'kill' that can only be executed by a creator of the place.
        .AddFunction(CreatorCommand, [ZirconDefaultGroup.Creator])
        // Builds the configuration for Zircon
        .Build()
);
```

This will create a global `print_message` that all players can run.

Then if run in Zircon:

The first argument of `RegisterFunction` takes a `ZirconFunctionBuilder` - which is the easiest way to build a function. `AddArguments` takes any number of arguments for types you want, in built types in Zircon you can use a string for. Otherwise you supply the type validator object.

# Troubleshooting
### Attempted to call AsyncFunction 'ZrSOi4/GetZirconInit' - which has no user defined callback
- You need to call `ZirconServer.Registry.Init` - an example of that can be found [here](https://github.com/roblox-aurora/zircon-example/blob/master/src/server/main.server.ts#L20)
### Unhandled promise rejection: ... Component returned invalid children ...
- You need to update your version of roact to the latest. That can be done via `npm i @rbxts/roact@latest`.
